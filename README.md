# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
Several employees are approaching retirement age and management needs information on the volume and impacted departments of the coming "silver tsunami".  This succession planning includes identifying the number of current employees approaching retirement by department and those eligible to participate as mentors in a new mentorship program where they would transition into a part-time role instead of retiring completely.

## Results 
* The majority of retiring employees are in senior roles
* There are significantly more employees approaching retirement than there are eligible employees for the mentorship program
* Further analysis is needed to cross-reference the number of retiring employees by department and title
* A multi-prong approach of promotions, hiring and mentoring will be needed to meet the vacancy demands created by the approaching retirements
